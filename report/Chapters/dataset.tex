In our work, we used the \textbf{Movie-Lens dataset} \cite{grouplens} which is a collection of movie rating data gathered from the MovieLens website. It is commonly used to build and evaluate movie-recommendation systems.

The dataset is composed of over 100 thousand ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies.
