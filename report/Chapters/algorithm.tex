We propose the algorithm based on the K-means clustering to group user-genre-movie combinations and Apropri algorithm and association rules mining to discover frequent and relevant patterns within the clusters.

First, the user rating data is combined with the information to create the user-genre-movie combinations. Then the system utilizes K-Means clustering to group user-genre-movie interactions based on rating similarities. This partitions users into clusters based on their genre preferences and movie rating behaviour. For each cluster, the system employs association rule mining to identify frequent co-occurrences of genres and specific rating values. These rules capture associations between user preferences for certain genre combinations and the ratings they tend to give.

To predict the rating for a new user-movie pair the system identifies the cluster most similar to the given user using the predefined labels. Then the relevant association rules are retrieved. If any of the rules matches the specific genre of the given movie a weighted average rating is calculated based on the confidence scores of the applicable rules and the predicted ratings from those rules. If no relevant cluster or rules are found the system outputs the mean of all the ratings associated with the user.
