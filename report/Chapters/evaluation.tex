We compared the performance of our system with 3 simpler methods:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Global Mean} - the rating returned for every user-movie pair is equal to the mean of all ratings in the dataset
    \item \textbf{Movie Mean} -  the rating returned for every user-movie pair is equal to the mean of all ratings in the dataset related to the specific movie
    \item \textbf{User Mean} - the rating returned for every user-movie pair is equal to the mean of all ratings in the dataset related given by the specific user
\end{enumerate}

Every approach was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The results of the tests are presented in the table below.
