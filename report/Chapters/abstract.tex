In the age of information overload and the ever-expanding volume of movies available to people all around the world movie recommender systems become a crucial tool to explore this area of entertainment. This paper presents a movie recommendation system, which leverages the K-means clustering algorithm and rules association to predict the rating a given user would give to a given film from the dataset. We evaluate the performance of the system using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and compare it with the simpler approaches based on mean values for the entire dataset, specific movie and specific user.
