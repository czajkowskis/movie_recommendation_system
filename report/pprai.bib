title = {A Hybrid Approach using Collaborative filtering and Content based Filtering for Recommender System},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {In today’s digital world, it has become an irksome task to find the content of one's liking in an endless variety of content that are being consumed like books, videos, articles, movies, etc. On the other hand there has been an emerging growth among the digital content providers who want to engage as many users on their service as possible for the maximum time. This gave birth to the recommender system comes wherein the content providers recommend users the content according to the users’ taste and liking. In this paper we have proposed a movie recommendation system. A movie recommendation is important in our social life due to its features such as suggesting a set of movies to users based on their interest, or the popularities of the movies. In this paper we are proposing a movie recommendation system that has the ability to recommend movies to a new user as well as the other existing users. It mines movie databases to collect all the important information, such as, popularity and attractiveness, which are required for recommendation. We use content-based and collaborative filtering and also hybrid filtering, which is a combination of the results of these two techniques, to construct a system that provides more precise recommendations concerning movies.}

  abstract={Recommendation systems are an important part of suggesting items especially in streaming services. For streaming movie services like Netflix, recommendation systems are essential for helping users find new movies to enjoy. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach based on autoencoders to produce a collaborative filtering system which predicts movie ratings for a user based on a large database of ratings from other users. Using the MovieLens dataset, we explore the use of deep learning to predict users' ratings on new movies, thereby enabling movie recommendations. To verify the novelty and accuracy of our deep learning approach, we compare our approach to standard collaborative filtering techniques: k-nearest-neighbor and matrix-factorization. The experimental results show that our recommendation system outperforms a user-based neighborhood baseline both in terms of root mean squared error on predicted ratings and in a survey in which users judge between recommendations from both systems.},

abstract={Recommender systems attempt to provide effective suggestions to each user based on their interests and behaviors. These recommendations usually match the personal user preferences and assist them in the decision-making process. With the ever-expanding growth of information on the web, online education systems, e-commerce, and, eventually, the emergence of social networks, the necessity of developing such systems is unavoidable. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are among the most important techniques used in recommender systems. Meanwhile, with the significant advances in deep learning in recent years, the use of this technology has been widely observed in recommender systems. In this study, a hybrid social recommender system utilizing a deep autoencoder network is introduced. The proposed approach employs collaborative and content-based filtering, as well as users' social influence. The social influence of each user is calculated based on his/her social characteristics and behaviors on Twitter. For the evaluation purpose, the required datasets have been collected from MovieTweetings and Open Movie Database. The evaluation results show that the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach have been improved compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Due to the availability of enormous number of products of same domain is increasing day by day the possibility of getting your desire product is getting less. Therefore, a recommendation not only helps you find the best probable product according to your preference but also increases the efficacy to find the product for you in less time interval. Artificial neural network has been producing a tremendous result in the practical solutions like image classification, speech recognitions and various AI problems. The use of neural network to build recommendations system can also be used as an auto encoder in various sector. The neural network contains many layers and each layer contains many perceptron which holds the weight. While the network gets trained, the weights of each perception are optimized and get adjusted. Building a simple neural network model for predicting recommendations with high accuracy is the objective of this work. The dataset used in this recommendations model is contributed by the Movie-lens archive. Manipulating the data into a right form and format is the most important part of the model. The whole work is performed, experimented and evaluated in python as it consists of many predefined useful libraries. The result of the recommender model is evaluated by finding the Hit-Ratio. The Hit-ratio obtained by this model is 87.},

abstract="A recommendation system is a system that provides suggestions to users for certain resources like books, movies, songs, etc., based on some data set. Movie recommendation systems usually predict what movies a user will like based on the attributes present in previously liked movies. Such recommendation systems are beneficial for organizations that collect data from large amounts of customers, and wish to effectively provide the best suggestions possible. A lot of factors can be considered while designing a movie recommendation system like the genre of the movie, actors present in it or even the director of the movie. The systems can recommend movies based on one or a combination of two or more attributes. In this paper, the recommendation system has been built on the type of genres that the user might prefer to watch. The approach adopted to do so is content-based filtering using genre correlation. The dataset used for the system is Movie Lens dataset. The data analysis tool used is R.",

abstract = {Content-based filtering (CBF), one of the most successful recommendation techniques, is based on correlations between contents. CBF uses item information, represented as attributes, to calculate the similarities between items. In this study, we propose a novel CBF method that uses a multiattribute network to effectively reflect several attributes when calculating correlations to recommend items to users. In the network analysis, we measure the similarities between directly and indirectly linked items. Moreover, our proposed method employs centrality and clustering techniques to consider the mutual relationships among items, as well as determine the structural patterns of these interactions. This mechanism ensures that a variety of items are recommended to the user, which improves the performance. We compared the proposed approach with existing approaches using MovieLens data, and found that our approach outperformed existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Our proposed method can address the sparsity problem and over-specialization problem that frequently affect recommender systems. Furthermore, the proposed method depends only on ratings data obtained from a user's own past information, and so it is not affected by the cold start problem.}

    abstract = { Over the last decade, there has been a burgeoning of data due to social media, e-commerce and overall digitisation of enterprises. The data is exploited to make informed choices, predict marketplace trends and patterns in consumer preferences. Recommendation systems have become ubiquitous after the penetration of internet services among the masses. The idea is to make use of filtering and clustering techniques to suggest items of interest to users. For a media commodity like movies, suggestions are made to users by finding user profiles of individuals with similar tastes. Initially, user preference is obtained by letting them rate movies of their choice. Upon usage, the recommender system will be able to understand the user better and suggest movies that are more likely to be rated higher. The experiment results on the MovieLens dataset provides a reliable model which is precise and generates more personalised movie recommendations compared to other models. }
